	abstract = {Computers are a central tool in the research process, enabling complex and large scale data analysis. As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognisable way for organising the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},

	abstract = {The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other’s work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.},

	abstract = {How do archaeologists share their research data, if at all? We review what data are, according to current influential definitions, and previous work on the benefits, costs, and norms of data sharing in the sciences broadly. To understand data sharing in archaeology, we present the results of three pilot studies: requests for data by e-mail, review of data availability in published articles, and analysis of archaeological datasets deposited in repositories. We find that archaeologists are often willing to share but that discipline-wide sharing is patchy and ad hoc. Legislation and mandates are effective at increasing data sharing, but editorial policies at journals lack adequate enforcement. Although most of the data available at repositories are licensed to enable flexible reuse, only a small proportion of the data are stored in structured formats for easy reuse. We present some suggestions for improving the state of date sharing in archaeology; among these is a standard for citing datasets to ensure that researchers making their data publicly available receive appropriate credit., ¿Cómo comparten los arqueólogos sus datos de investigación, si lo hacen? Revisamos qué datos son, de acuerdo con las actuales definiciones influyentes, y el trabajo previo sobre los beneficios, costos y estándares de intercambio de datos en las ciencias en general. Para comprender el intercambio de datos en arqueología, presentamos los resultados de tres estudios piloto: solicitudes de datos por correo electrónico; revisión de la disponibilidad de datos en artículos publicados y análisis de conjuntos de datos arqueológicos depositados en repositorios. Encontramos que los arqueólogos están a menudo dispuestos a compartir, pero el intercambio de toda la disciplina es desigual y ad hoc. La legislación y los mandatos son eficaces para aumentar el intercambio de datos, pero las políticas editoriales de las revistas carecen de aplicación adecuada. Aunque la mayoría de los datos disponibles en repositorios están autorizados para permitir la reutilización flexible, sólo una pequeña proporción de los datos se almacena en formatos estructurados para su fácil reutilización. Presentamos algunas sugerencias para mejorar el estado de la fecha de intercambio en arqueología, incluyendo un estándar para citar conjuntos de datos para asegurar que los investigadores que hacen sus datos disponibles públicamente reciben crédito apropiado.},

	abstract = {There is an argument in philosophy of science that revolutions in science are either idea-driven or tool-driven. We explore this debate in light of recent efforts by many scientific disciplines to embrace methods to improve the reproducibility of their research. One of the most profound changes driven by this concern for reproducibility and transparency is from analysing data using tools dependent on point-and-clicking with a mouse in closed source software, to tools based on writing scripts in open source programming languages and making them openly available. We present bibliometric evidence for this change in ecology and in archaeology to test if the adoption of these new tools is revolutionary or transformational. We identify a positive citation effect for papers that use the open source programming language R. We discuss how computational approaches to improving reproducibility and transparency in archaeology are mediated and transformed by the use of R code.},
